## GitHub activity data

The activity route uses GitHub's public REST API for public repository count, stars, and repository languages. The contribution calendar comes from [github-contributions-api](https://github.com/grubersjoe/github-contributions-api), whose documented JSON response is validated server-side; its upstream results are cached for one hour. The route also caches its response and the browser keeps a last-known-good copy for offline or upstream-error states.

No GitHub token is required or configured. A scheduled daily refresh is not configured; refreshes happen when the route is requested and its cache expires. The contribution service is an external dependency and may be unavailable, in which case saved activity is shown when available.
